super_over_outcome.py

Simulates each delivery in a Super Over using a specialized scoring matrix
and “excitement” multipliers, while aligning with the new 60% pitch‐influence
/ 40% player‐skill rating system defined in ball_outcome.py. All original
features—SUPER_OVER_SCORING_MATRIX, commentary_templates, and frame logic—
are preserved, with only the internal probability computations updated to
remove the old pitch_factor and incorporate get_pitch_run_multiplier and
get_pitch_wicket_multiplier instead.

    Simulates one delivery in a Super Over. Uses SUPER_OVER_SCORING_MATRIX
    plus “excitement” modifiers:

      - Fours/Sixes get an extra 1.2× boost for “super‐over excitement.”
        If the batter has already hit ≥3 boundaries in this over, further
        boundary chance is reduced by 10% (×0.9).

      - Wicket chances are 1.3× higher due to pressure. If the batter has
        hit ≥2 boundaries, wicket chance is further boosted by 1.4×.

      - Extras are 1.2× more probable under pressure.

    All “run” and “wicket” probabilities blend pitch influence (60%) with
    player skill (40%), using get_pitch_run_multiplier and
    get_pitch_wicket_multiplier from ball_outcome.py. Extras remain purely
    a function of bowler error.

    Parameters:
        batter (dict): {
            "name": str,
            "batting_rating": int (0–100),
            "batting_hand": "Left" | "Right"
        }
        bowler (dict): {
            "name": str,
            "bowling_rating": int (0–100),
            "fielding_rating": int (0–100),
            "bowling_type": one of allowed styles or "",
            "bowling_hand": "Left" | "Right"
        }
        pitch (str): one of {"Green", "Flat", "Dry", "Hard", "Dead"}.
        streak (dict): e.g. {"boundaries": int} representing number of
                        boundaries hit so far in this over by the current batter.
        over_number (int): zero-based index of the current over in the match.
                           For a Super Over, this will typically be 0.
        batter_runs (int): total runs scored by the batter so far in the match
                           (used only if additional context is required).

    Returns:
