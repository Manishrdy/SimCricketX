engine/bowler_manager.py
========================

Centralises all bowler selection and constraint enforcement for any cricket
format.  Previously this logic was scattered across ~15 inline snippets in
match.py (all hardcoding the T20 quota of 4 overs).

Rules enforced
--------------
1. Bowling quota   — a bowler may not exceed format_config.max_bowler_overs
                     per innings (4 for T20, 10 for ListA).
2. No-consecutive  — when format_config.allow_consecutive_overs is False, a
                     bowler may not bowl two overs in a row (ListA rule).
3. Fresh-bowler    — every bowler marked will_bowl must bowl at least 1 over
                     if the remaining overs allow it (mirrors existing logic
                     in match.py).
4. Fatigue         — diminishing effectiveness multiplier per over bowled,
                     extended to 10 overs for ListA.

Usage (in match.py)

    selected = <pick from eligible>

    # At the end of each over
    self.bowler_manager.record_over_completion(selected["name"],
                                               runs_this_over)

        Return bowlers eligible to bowl the current over.

        Eligibility criteria (in priority order):
        1. Player is marked will_bowl in the XI.

        3. Did not bowl the immediately preceding over

        If applying all criteria produces an empty list, the method relaxes
        constraint 3 (consecutive), then constraint 2 (quota), returning the
        least-restricted non-empty pool found.  This mirrors what a captain
        does when forced to use an irregular bowler.

        the number of overs remaining, those fresh bowlers are returned
